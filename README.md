# Offlink - A Decentralized P2P Off-Ramping Solution

**_Built with love with Celo Protocol_**

## Introduction

Offlink provides a decentralized peer-to-peer platform for crypto traders to exchange their stablecoins, especially cUSD, for fiat.

## Problems & Solutions

We understand that most off-ramping solutions for cUSD in Africa are centralized, making it harder for holders to convert their stablecoins with fair exchange rates. This had prompted us to build a solution that was completely decentralized with fair pricing and fast transaction completion time.



## Features

At the hackathon, we successfully implemented functionality for users within Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya to offramp on the platform:

A user can perform the following actions
1. Signup
2. Sign In
3. Initiate an offramp as a seller
4. Accept an offramp as a buyer
5. Update profile with bank details

## Future Plan

To stay relevant in the future, we understand that we must continue to implement new features, such as:

1. Expanding our market beyond african countries
2. Improve user experience.
